Cordova Hooks (cdva-hooks)
==========================
Automates the creation of a Cordova project's hooks folders. The module accepts the following command-line switches:

-all: Create all folders
-l: List all hooks

Usage:

To display this help file, issue the cdva-hooks command without any parameters:

cdva-hooks

To create all hooks folders, use the following command:

    cdva-hooks -all
	
To list the available hooks options use the following command:

    cdva-hooks -l

To create folders for specific hooks, specify one or more hooks on the command-line. 

    cdva-hooks hook_list

Example:

    cdva-hooks platform_add prepare
	
This will create hooks folders for the 'platform_add' and 'prepare commands'. Since both of those have before and after options, the command will create the following folders:

* before_platform_add
* after_platform_add
* before_prepare
* after_prepare

Note: The Windows Phone-only hook, 'pre_package', does not have a before or after option, so it will only create one folder.
